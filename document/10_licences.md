# Licences: (florian?/lmi)

## Context
Defines the rights how to use the dataset.

## Usage Note:
- **Use Terms of Use** is a must for confederation level, it is a must to be listed on [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss). Use the CV: [VOCAB-CH-LICENSE]
- To use licences from SPDX (TODO: how to use, concrete example).
- Multiple licences can be mentioned if it makes sense.

## Discussion:
- Michèle gives an input from the side of opendata.swiss.
- Shall we use it still? Or rework? [DCAT-AP CH Vocabulary](https://dcat-ap.ch/vocabulary/licenses/20210623.html)
  - Instead of domain `dcat-ap.ch`.

- **We are forced to use a single controlled vocabulary, the DCAT-AP CH license vocabulary.**  
  - Instead, it should be recommended.  
  - **Why?** Many 3rd parties may use our standard. They may need to use different licenses.  
  - There is no need for added restrictions… or is there?

- **We should add the SPDX License List** to the recommended list of vocabularies.  
  - **Why?** This is a list of commonly used licenses.  
  - *Example:* If an engineering school publishes data with one of those, we will need it.

- **Examples should be added for other licences, especially SPDX.**
