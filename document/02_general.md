# General Remarks and Guidelines for Controlled Vocabularies

## Examples / Best practice how to use Controled Vocabularies in RDB (lmi)
* We should add a short explanation how to save an Identifier (IRI/URI) in a local system. (Simply the URI string.)
* A short explanation how we get from an Identifier (IRI/URI) to the according, multilingual labels, and where the authorative dataset of the CV is available.
* Optional: An explanation how to save an Identifier with its labels in a Relational Database. Especially if we have indirections as in Qualified Attribution etc. 

## Rules regarding Controlled Vocabularies (lmi)
* The main goal is to use the same Identifiers as others for the same things, so in doubt it is useful, to copy from other examples.
* If a controlled vocabulary is missing an entry. First always try to open a question at the authority of the controlled vocabulary. Only if you get no answer in reasonable time, or it is clear that the entry only makes sense in the Context of Switzerland, contact the authors of this standard.
* Only if you can't find a good solution by using an entry from a controlled vocabularies consider these options:
  1. Look for another controlled vocabulary, or a less closed source, with clear Identifiers. E.g Wikidata or Termdat and use these instead. (Wikidata can always be extend to add new concepts.)
  2. Before not adding an available information, because you can't find a fitting identifier, better add it as text.

## Good examples in the wild
* Placeholder to add good examples, once the standard is active.
